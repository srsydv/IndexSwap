# IndexSwap
A modular DeFi vault framework for managing tokenized portfolios with pluggable strategies, robust fee mechanics, and role‑based operations. The core ERC4626‑style Vault accepts deposits of a single asset (e.g., USDC), mints shares, allocates capital across multiple strategies, and periodically harvests yield and fees.
